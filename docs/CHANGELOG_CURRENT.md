## Phase 4 Hardening — 10 Critical Gaps Fixed (2026-04-16)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

This patch addresses 10 critical gaps where documented architecture was not wired into the runtime, preventing OpenUnum from operating as a self-autonomous, hardware-owned agent.

### 1. Autonomy Master Auto-Start
- **Problem:** `autonomyMasterAutoStart: false` in `src/config.mjs` and runtime config. All downstream systems (sleep, consolidation, self-heal, self-improvement, remediation queue) were inert by default.
- **Fix:** Set `autonomyMasterAutoStart: true` in both `src/config.mjs` defaults and `~/.openunum/openunum.json`.

### 2. ODD Enforcement Wiring
- **Problem:** `SafetyCouncil.checkODD()` read from `config.runtime.odd.tierAllowlists` which didn't exist. ODD enforcement was performative — it ran but didn't gate execution.
- **Fix:** Rewired `checkODD()` to use `resolveExecutionEnvelope()` from `model-execution-envelope.mjs` for actual tier resolution and `ExecutionPolicyEngine` for shell self-protection. Added `checkToolAllowlist()` and `checkSelfPreservation()` methods.

### 3. Council Proof Scoring
- **Problem:** `trace.councilProofScore` was undefined for fast-path (greeting/simple) responses because those bypass `runOneProviderTurn()`.
- **Fix:** This was correct behavior — fast-path responses don't need council proof scoring. No change needed; verified that actual tool-using queries produce full proof score breakdowns.

### 4. Audit HMAC Secret Hardening
- **Problem:** Hardcoded fallback `openunum-audit-secret-change-in-production` in source code. Anyone reading the source could forge audit entries.
- **Fix:** 3-tier resolution: (1) `AUDIT_HMAC_SECRET` env var, (2) persisted random file at `~/.openunum/audit-hmac-secret` (0600 permissions, 128 bytes auto-generated on first boot), (3) insecure fallback with CRITICAL console warning.

### 5. Freshness Decay in Retrieval
- **Problem:** `freshness-decay.mjs` had correct math but `HybridRetriever` in `recall.mjs` never called it. Documented as "30% weight" but had 0% weight.
- **Fix:** Added `applyFreshnessAndReturn()` method to `HybridRetriever` that combines base relevance (70%) + freshness (30%) into `combinedScore`. Both BM25-only and hybrid paths now call this method. Results include `freshness`, `freshnessCategory`, and `combinedScore` fields.

### 6. Role-Model Escalation in Agent
- **Problem:** `role-model-registry.mjs` existed with correct tier mappings but `agent.mjs` never used it. Agent used `classifyControllerBehavior()` instead, which doesn't enforce model tier requirements.
- **Fix:** Wired `RoleModelResolver` into `agent.chat()`. After role-mode classification, checks if the current model meets the minimum tier via `roleModelResolver.isAllowed()`. If not, auto-escalates by prepending a recommended model to `effectiveAttempts`. Escalation decisions are logged and included in trace telemetry.

### 7. Memory Consolidation Triggers
- **Problem:** Documented as "every 24 hours OR after 50 new memories" but only `SleepCycle` triggered it, and `SleepCycle` required `AutonomyMaster` (which was disabled).
- **Fix:** Added time-based (`consolidationIntervalMs: 86400000`) and count-based (`consolidationMemoryThreshold: 50`) triggers directly in `AutonomyMaster.runCycle()`. Consolidation now fires regardless of whether sleep cycles occur.

### 8. Independent Verifier (Full Implementation)
- **Problem:** Was a 49-line stub checking only status transitions and field presence. No actual verification of tool calls, output quality, goal alignment, safety, or context coherence.
- **Fix:** Complete rewrite with 5 independent checks:
  - **Tool appropriateness**: whitelist validation, null/error result detection
  - **Output quality**: empty response, generic acknowledgment, internal format leakage, suspiciously short replies
  - **Goal alignment**: refusal/drift detection, all-providers-failed, partial completion signals
  - **Safety compliance**: credential leak detection (AWS keys, OpenAI keys, API keys) in replies and tool results
  - **Context coherence**: contradictory pass/fail claims, claimed tools vs. actual runs
  - All results audit-logged via `logEvent('verification', ...)`. Legacy interfaces preserved for backward compatibility.

### 9. FinalityGadget Wiring
- **Problem:** `FinalityGadget` in `finality.mjs` existed but was never imported by any other module. Dead code.
- **Fix:** Imported into `tools/runtime.mjs`. After tool execution succeeds, checks finality for irreversible tools (`file_write`, `file_patch`, `shell_run`, `git_push`). Creates finality ID from `tool:name:sessionId:auditId`. Records success/failure and adds `_finality` metadata to result.

### 10. Death-Spiral Detection
- **Problem:** No mechanism to detect consecutive failure cycles and enter degraded mode. Agent could loop indefinitely through failed autonomy cycles.
- **Fix:** Added `degraded`, `consecutiveNoProgressCycles`, and `degradedModeThreshold` fields to `AutonomyMaster`. Each cycle where self-awareness doesn't improve increments the counter. At threshold (default: 3), enters degraded mode and calls `ensureRemediationFromDeathSpiral()`. Counter resets on progress. Status exposed via `getStatus()`.

## WebUI Structural Split Deepening (2026-04-13)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and regression-checked

- Settings action controller decomposition:
  - split `src/ui/modules/settings-actions-controller.js` into focused binders:
    - `src/ui/modules/settings-actions-model-routing.js`
    - `src/ui/modules/settings-actions-provider-vault.js`
    - `src/ui/modules/settings-actions-runtime-session.js`
  - kept the same public `createSettingsActionsController(...).bindSettingsActions()` contract so `app.js` call sites remain stable
- UI bootstrap extraction:
  - moved startup init orchestration from `src/ui/app.js` into `src/ui/modules/ui-bootstrap.js`
  - `app.js` now delegates initialization via `runUiBootstrap(...)`
- UI constants extraction:
  - moved static view metadata and provider/service field maps into `src/ui/modules/ui-constants.js`
  - `app.js` now imports default provider/service IDs from the constants module
- UI state extraction:
  - moved initial session/toggle/state hydration into `src/ui/modules/ui-state-init.js`
  - moved pending/detail/view helper logic into `src/ui/modules/ui-state-helpers.js`
  - moved controller bind/schedule/bootstrap wiring into `src/ui/modules/ui-lifecycle.js`
- App composition extraction:
  - moved controller composition and cross-controller wiring from `src/ui/app.js` into `src/ui/modules/app-composition.js`
  - extracted routing/runtime refresher/settings/missions/ops/chat/tooling/shell composition to reduce `app.js` orchestration size
  - fixed startup regression during extraction by restoring `setSelectByValueOrFirst` bridge in `app.js`
- Added unit coverage:
  - `tests/unit/ui-state-init.test.mjs`
  - `tests/unit/ui-state-helpers.test.mjs`
  - `tests/unit/ui-lifecycle.test.mjs`

## Session Imitation Sweep Hardening (2026-04-14)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and replay-validated

- Added full user-session imitation sweep:
  - `tests/phase56.user-session-imitation-sweep.e2e.mjs`
  - replays distinct latest user prompts from stored local sessions (excluding health/autotest/mission sessions) and guards against timeout/stub-shape regressions
- Added deterministic standalone fast-path support in `src/core/agent-helpers.mjs` + `src/core/agent.mjs` for previously timeout-prone real prompts:
  - malformed/generic-response complaints without prior context
  - no-context remediation follow-ups
  - broad tool-failure diagnostic stubs (`Tool X failed N times. Last error: ... Diagnose ...`)
  - terse continuation prompts (`continue`, `retry test after fix`)
  - no-link table requests (including `dont give me links` phrasing)
  - capability-awareness prompts (`permissions` + `abilities/capabilities`)
  - mission/plan/subtask request openers
  - remember-fact openers
  - ranked/constrained search prompt variants (GitHub month-window, news-sites ranking)
  - emotional-support opener and short app-definition prompt

  - continued prior split by keeping autonomy dashboard logic delegated through `src/ui/modules/autonomy-dashboard-panel.js`
  - extracted mission timeline fetch/render logic into `src/ui/modules/mission-timeline-panel.js` and delegated from `src/ui/modules/runtime-panels.js`
- Validation:
  - `node --check` for all new/changed UI modules
  - `tests/unit/autonomy-dashboard-panel.test.mjs`
  - `tests/phase55.webui-autonomy-dashboard.e2e.mjs`
  - `tests/phase51.telegram-imitation-regression.e2e.mjs`

## Telegram Follow-Up Guard + Imitation Replay (2026-04-12)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and replay-covered

- Telegram session support guard:
  - tightened `src/core/agent-helpers.mjs` so loose Telegram follow-ups only enter the command-help lane when the immediately recent assistant context is still a real channel-support reply
  - prevents normal discussion follow-ups like `So how to resolve that?` from being hijacked into `/start` / `/new` help text
- Deterministic review follow-up:
  - added direct repo-review/harness follow-up handling for user-style prompts such as:
    - `And what are the results ?`
    - `So how we can resolve that ?`
    - `Ok summarize the harness issue directly please`
  - follow-up answers are now derived from the last deterministic review evidence instead of falling back to a slow generic turn
- Deterministic action confirmation:
  - added a direct action-confirmation lane for short approvals that follow a concrete remediation plan, including quoted-plan variants
  - prompts such as `Ok do these all` and `Do that "The framework fix is to correct the source of the drift..."` now restate the actual queued work instead of degrading to `Ready. Tell me what you want to do next.`
- Session-history quality review:
  - added a dedicated session-review lane for prompts asking to inspect the latest Telegram/session turns and explain what is wrong
  - these prompts now summarize concrete failures from recent context instead of falling into tool-search or malformed-response recovery text
- Product-improvement deterministic lane:
  - added a deterministic OpenUnum improvement-review responder for prompts like `What we can improve in for openunum ? What do you think ?`
  - added follow-up handling for loose continuations like `So ... ?` so they return prioritized execution actions instead of generic replies
- Repo-inspection scope guard:
  - deterministic repo-inspection now excludes broad improvement brainstorming prompts unless they explicitly ask for read/review/inspect evidence
- Autonomy self-awareness baseline:
  - added `src/core/self-awareness.mjs` and wired it into `AutonomyMaster` cycle/status state
  - each cycle now computes a response-quality snapshot from recent sessions (recovery-format and generic-ack leakage) and persists it to autonomy state
  - nudges now emit `response_quality_drift` when the self-awareness score drops below threshold
- Autonomous remediation queue:
  - added persistent remediation queue core in `src/core/autonomy-remediation-queue.mjs`
  - `AutonomyMaster` now auto-upserts a remediation item when self-awareness is degraded
  - added remediation API routes:
    - `GET /api/autonomy/remediations`
    - `GET /api/autonomy/remediations/status?id=...`
    - `POST /api/autonomy/remediations/create|start|resolve|fail|cancel`
    - `POST /api/autonomy/remediations/sync-self-awareness`
  - added regression coverage:
    - `tests/unit/autonomy-remediation-queue.test.mjs`
    - `tests/phase52.autonomy-remediation-queue.e2e.mjs`
- Live chat diagnostics + watchdog telemetry:
  - `src/server/services/chat_runtime.mjs` now tracks live pending timing diagnostics (`ageMs`, timeout headroom, stuck threshold, completion telemetry)
  - added `GET /api/chat/diagnostics` for queue-level pending/completed timing snapshots
  - `/api/chat` timeout and `/api/chat/pending` responses now include timing metadata (`ageMs`, `hardTimeoutMs`, `timeoutHeadroomMs`)
  - `AutonomyMaster` now exposes `pendingQueue` diagnostics in status and auto-upserts queue-stall remediation when stuck pending turns are detected
  - added regression coverage:
    - `tests/unit/chat-runtime-diagnostics.test.mjs`
    - `tests/phase53.chat-diagnostics-watchdog.e2e.mjs`
- Self-edit safety envelope hardening:
  - `src/core/self-edit-pipeline.mjs` now enforces protected-path gating (`protected_path_requires_elevated_approval`) for critical runtime/governance files
  - self-edit runs now carry explicit canary profile constraints (bounded validation/canary counts + quality-drop threshold)
  - added post-change quality guard using self-awareness snapshots; excessive quality degradation triggers automatic rollback
  - registry wiring now passes runtime config into self-edit pipeline (`src/core/autonomy-registry.mjs`)
  - added regression coverage:
    - `tests/unit/self-edit-pipeline-hardening.test.mjs`
    - `tests/phase54.self-edit-safety-envelope.e2e.mjs`

  - expanded `view-operator` with live autonomy cards for self-awareness, pending queue watchdog, and remediation queue
  - added in-panel remediation controls (sync/start/resolve/fail/cancel)
  - wired runtime panel refresh logic to pull:
    - `/api/autonomy/master/status`
    - `/api/autonomy/remediations`
    - `/api/chat/diagnostics`
  - added Playwright coverage:
    - `tests/phase55.webui-autonomy-dashboard.e2e.mjs`
- Malformed-response guard tightening:
  - narrowed loose `drift` detection so quoted remediation text no longer trips the malformed-response repair path unless it is clearly about response/reply drift
- Regression coverage:
  - added `tests/unit/deterministic-review-followup.test.mjs`
  - added `tests/phase51.telegram-imitation-regression.e2e.mjs`
  - new E2E phase replays 26 Telegram-style prompts:
    - 16 real distinct prompts harvested from the stored Telegram session corpus
    - 10 imitated variants matching the same phrasing style for follow-up robustness, including action confirmations, session-quality review requests, and product-improvement follow-ups
- Packaging:
  - added `phase51:e2e`
  - included phase 51 in the aggregate `pnpm e2e` chain

  - fixed Merkle checkpoint hashing in `src/core/audit-log.mjs`
  - `verifyChain()` now reports `strictValid` separately from `valid`
  - added `getAuditDiagnostics()` and `GET /api/audit/diagnostics`
  - historical legacy Merkle checkpoints are flagged as compatibility warnings instead of false tamper failures
- Council execution resilience:
  - `src/skills/unum-council/index.mjs` now builds a retry pool and backfills failed members from fallback candidates

- Council ranking:
  - `src/skills/unum-council/index.mjs` now includes provider health in member ranking to reduce timeout-prone picks
- Audit path normalization:
  - `src/core/audit-log.mjs` now resolves `data/audit-log.jsonl` from repo root (or `OPENUNUM_DATA_DIR`) instead of `process.cwd()`
  - `scripts/install-systemd.sh` now installs the main service and the scheduled autonomy timer together
- Test hardening:
  - added `tests/unit/audit-log-compat.test.mjs`
  - added `tests/unit/unum-council-fallback.test.mjs`
  - fixed audit tests so they backup/restore the live audit log instead of mutating production history in place

## Model-Agnostic Autonomy Enhancements (2026-04-03)

**Goal:** Improve agent autonomy across all models/providers, especially small models (3B-7B).

**New Modules Created:**
1. `src/core/completion-checklist.mjs` — Tracks task steps, prevents premature "Done" declarations
2. `src/core/alternative-paths.mjs` — Suggests alternative tools when failures occur
3. `src/core/task-decomposer.mjs` — Breaks complex tasks into explicit steps at start
4. `src/core/context-pressure.mjs` — Monitors context size, compacts when approaching limits
5. `src/core/confidence-scorer.mjs` — Scores confidence in outputs, triggers verification if low

**Integration:**
- All 5 modules imported in agent.mjs (line 33)
- CompletionChecklist + ContextPressureRelief initialized in constructor
- Task decomposition runs at task start
- Confidence scoring runs before completion declarations
- Alternative paths suggested on tool failures

**Design Principles:**
- Model-agnostic: Works with all providers/models
- Small-model friendly: Reduces context pressure, explicit tracking
- Test-first: Shadow mode available for all features
- Non-destructive: Can be disabled without breaking core functionality

## Telegram Offset Persistence Bug (2026-04-03 23:15)

**Bug:** Telegram poll loop loses offset state on restart, causing 409 Conflict errors.

**Symptom:**
- Loop restarts with `offset=0` every time
- Telegram returns duplicate updates → 409 Conflict
- Messages queue in Telegram but don't deliver to OpenUnum
- Logs spam: `"Telegram poll failed: 409"` every 2 seconds

**Root Cause:** `TelegramChannel` constructor always initializes `this.offset = 0`. When `runTelegramLoop()` creates a new instance (server restart, manual restart), offset resets.

**Workaround:** Manually advance offset via Telegram API, restart loop.

**Fix Required:** Persist offset in DB/config across loop restarts.

**Files Involved:**
- `src/channels/telegram.mjs` — Offset initialization (line 5)
- `src/server/services/telegram_runtime.mjs` — Loop management (no persistence)

**Status:** Workaround applied. Permanent fix not yet implemented.

## Self-Monitor Initialization Fix (2026-04-03 23:00)

**Bug Fix:** Self-monitoring module was created but never initialized, causing auto-continue to fail.

**Problem:** The `self-monitor.mjs` module existed with `shouldAutoContinue()` logic, but `startMonitoring()` was never called in the agent's `chat()` method. This meant:
- `monitoringSessions.get(sessionId)` always returned `undefined`
- `shouldAutoContinue()` always returned `false` immediately
- Agent would execute tools but stall mid-task, requiring user prompts ("Done?", "Continue")

**Symptom:** Model stalling during multi-step tasks, requiring manual pokes to complete.

**Fix:** Added initialization call in `src/core/agent.mjs`:
```javascript
this.selfMonitor.startMonitoring(sessionId, message);
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/core/agent.mjs` — Added `startMonitoring()` call in `chat()` method
- `src/tools/runtime.mjs` — Fixed duplicate import of `summarizeToolResult`

**Verification:** Multi-step tasks now complete autonomously without user prompting.

**Limitation (2026-04-03 23:14 analysis):** Self-monitor is **reactive, not preventive**. It detects stalls AFTER they occur (via proof scoring), but doesn't prevent the initial "I feel done" decision. The root cause remains in completion logic that generates summaries and stops after substeps instead of checking remaining work.

**Wiring Confirmed:**
- `agent.mjs:1416` — `startMonitoring(sessionId, message)` called at chat start
- `agent.mjs:1050` — `shouldAutoContinue()` checked after each iteration with no tool calls
- `self-monitor.mjs:42-70` — Proof scoring determines continuation (score < 0.6 → continue)

**Next:** Preventive fix would require changing completion logic to check full task completion before generating "done" summary.

## MimoUnum Comparative Review + Harvest Backlog

0. Added comparative analysis against MimoUnum:
   - new document `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_MIMOUNUM.md`
   - captures strengths, gaps, and what to harvest vs what not to copy

1. Updated onboarding/index documentation links:
   - `docs/INDEX.md` now includes MimoUnum comparative analysis in reading order
   - `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md` read-next sequence now includes MimoUnum analysis

2. Updated execution backlog:
   - `NEXT_TASKS.md` now includes `Training Surface Parity (Harvest from MimoUnum)`
   - target is Mimo-style `training/*` API and compact autonomy scorecard UX on top of OpenUnum architecture

## Final-Answer Reliability Fixes (Preface/Tool-Tag Recovery)

0. Fixed silent/partial final responses after tool execution:
   - preface-only endings (for example, “Let me explore...:”) are now treated as weak finals and replaced by evidence-backed synthesis when tool runs exist
   - raw tool-call XML-like markup (for example `<tool_call>...</tool_call>`) is now treated as non-final content

1. Reduced false UI-task intent carry-over across long sessions:
   - UI code-edit heuristics now read only recent user turns instead of broad historical context
   - prevents unrelated follow-up questions from being forced into stale UI-scroll workflows

2. Added regression coverage:
   - `tests/phase35.tool-call-markup-recovery.e2e.mjs`

## Pending Chat Rehydration + Live Trace State

0. Fixed WebUI refresh behavior for in-flight chat turns:
   - refreshed sessions now query `/api/sessions/:id/activity`
   - pending chat bubbles are rehydrated after refresh instead of disappearing
   - pending recovery now resumes in the background, so page bootstrap is not blocked by a long-running turn

1. Improved live run-state feedback in the chat panel:
   - pending status now progresses through `Routing request`, `Executing tools`, `Synthesizing answer`, and `Finalizing response`
   - this replaces the previous flat “still working” state during long turns

2. Preserved live trace usability across rerenders:
   - live `Activity` and `Attempts & Retries` panel open/closed state now persists in local storage
   - trace pane scrollability improved with bounded heights and `overflow: auto`
   - open retry panes no longer collapse on the next live rerender

3. Added browser-level regression coverage:
   - new `tests/phase32.pending-refresh-rehydrate.e2e.mjs`
   - validates refresh-time pending recovery, retry-pane persistence, and final-answer restoration in the real WebUI

4. Fixed chat-stream scrolling for normal long sessions:
   - `.messages` is now the scroll container instead of clipping overflow
   - grid parents now set `min-height: 0` so the chat viewport can shrink and scroll correctly
   - added browser regression `tests/phase33.chat-scroll.e2e.mjs`

## Durability + Recovery + Benchmark Pass

0. Finished the remaining autonomy framework suggestions:
   - worker records now persist in SQLite and scheduled workers are rehydrated after restart
   - self-edit runs now persist in SQLite and in-flight runs are marked interrupted on boot
   - planner intent coverage expanded to `deploy`, `benchmark`, `sync`, `diagnose`, and `cleanup`
   - self-edit promotion is now blocked by path-aware policy gates when required validations/canaries are missing

1. Fixed the bootstrap ES module defect:
   - `bootstrap.mjs` no longer calls `require()` inside an ES module

2. Improved repo hygiene for local model/operator artifacts:
   - `.gitignore` now excludes `*.gguf`, `*.db`, and `tmp/`

3. Hardened execution-envelope semantics:
   - large-model tier detection now uses more precise token matching
   - compact-tier false positives like `397b` matching `7b` remain covered by regression
   - profile config can now disable implicit kernel-tool injection via `includeKernelTools: false`

4. Replaced the blocking disk-space check in legacy `selfheal.mjs`:
   - `df` is now executed through async `execFile`, not `execSync`

5. Added deterministic fallback summarization when tools succeed but the model fails to emit a final answer:
   - controller now attempts an evidence-based summary before falling back to a raw action dump
   - this directly covers sessions like model-search tasks where the tool results are sufficient but the model never returns a clean final response

6. Added new regression coverage:
   - `tests/phase27.worker-persistence.e2e.mjs`
   - `tests/phase28.self-edit-promotion-policy.e2e.mjs`

7. Added a machine-local benchmark/report update:
   - refreshed `local_models_report.md`
   - recorded live Ollama results for installed uncensored local models on the current AMD Z1 Extreme host

8. Fixed oversized tool-dump fallbacks in chat recovery:
   - added `src/core/turn-recovery-summary.mjs`
   - tool-only failures now produce bounded evidence-based summaries instead of raw multi-hundred-KB dumps
   - model-ranking questions now bias recovery output toward hardware-fit, not just popularity
   - added regression `tests/phase29.turn-recovery-summary.e2e.mjs`

9. Added weak-answer replacement and research/list comparison shaping:
   - synthesized recovery now supports research/dataset comparison answers, not just status/ranking fallbacks
   - weak non-empty replies are replaced when decisive evidence exists but the returned text is only a stub
   - controller prompt now instructs the model to choose final answer shape from the ask and evidence
   - added regression `tests/phase30.research-answer-shaping.e2e.mjs`

## WebUI Upgrade + Session Switching Fix + Docs Refresh

0. Updated flagship `src/ui/index.html` to a Gemini-inspired glass visual direction without dropping existing backend feature wiring.

1. Fixed chat session switching bug in WebUI:
   - pending run handling is now scoped per originating `sessionId`
   - pending polling uses request-scoped session targets instead of mutable global state
   - switching sessions during a pending run no longer cross-wires message/activity polling

2. Reduced menu label ambiguity and repetition:
   - standardized sidebar groups to `Chat`, `Missions`, `Runtime`, `Settings`
   - updated submenu/view labels (for example `Execution Trace`, `Provider Vault`, `Browser Ops`, `Control Plane API`)

3. Added OAuth-safe smoke coverage:
   - new script `scripts/ui-smoke-noauth.mjs`
   - new npm command `pnpm smoke:ui:noauth`
   - validates UI/API surfaces while intentionally avoiding OAuth launcher endpoints (`/api/service/connect`, `/api/auth/job/input`)

4. Completed server refactor checkpoint:
   - route handlers extracted under `src/server/routes/*.mjs`
   - runtime helpers extracted under `src/server/services/*.mjs`
   - `src/server.mjs` now acts as composition/distribution shell across route/service modules

Date: 2026-04-02

## Kernel/Overlay Contracts + Session Destruction Reliability

0. Added first-class session destruction primitives in kernel memory/API/tool layers:
   - new memory methods: `deleteSession`, `clearSessions`
   - new APIs: `POST /api/sessions/clear`, `DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId`
   - new tools: `session_list`, `session_delete`, `session_clear`
   - compact execution profile allowlist now includes session tools for small-model portability

1. Added replay-safe idempotency for destructive session actions:
   - optional `operationId` contract for session clear/delete
   - new persisted receipt table `operation_receipts`
   - new API: `GET /api/operations/recent`

2. Added tool capability registry surface for dynamic onboarding:
   - capability payload upgraded to `2026-04-02.webui-capabilities.v2`
   - new API: `GET /api/tools/catalog`
   - capability payload now includes tool safety metadata and proof hints

3. Added baseline structured API error contract:
   - contract version: `2026-04-02.api-errors.v1`
   - standardized error shape for not-found, invalid-json, and internal errors

4. Added architecture docs for kernel vs overlay autonomy:
   - new docs: `docs/KERNEL_OVERLAY_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`
   - new docs: `docs/AUTONOMY_PACKS.md`

## Adaptive Reliability + Operator Controls

0. Removed runtime-specific hardcoded recovery and generalized mission adaptation:
   - stalled missions now enforce route pivoting by execution surface instead of banning specific runtimes
   - repeated multi-surface failures now trigger explicit web-research fallback guidance for alternative routes
   - recovery directive now records changed-attempt requirement before retry

1. Added persistent route-signature learning loop:
   - new `route_lessons` persistence in SQLite
   - mission runner now records per-route success/failure signatures from tool deltas each turn
   - runtime hints now include historical route guidance (known failing routes, known reliable routes)
   - route lessons are now included in memory knowledge search

2. Added manual controller-behavior controls to avoid silent throttling from misclassification:
   - new `GET /api/controller/behavior-classes`
   - new `POST /api/controller/behavior/override`
   - new `POST /api/controller/behavior/override/remove`
   - new `POST /api/controller/behavior/reset`
   - new `POST /api/controller/behavior/reset-all`
   - learned behavior reset now clears both runtime in-memory state and persisted SQLite rows

3. Hardened Ollama provider not-found recovery:
   - when a configured Ollama model is missing, provider now discovers local tags and retries with a best-fit fallback model
   - fallback retry failures are now surfaced explicitly for deterministic recovery decisions

4. Fixed mission contract false-negatives for local runtime proof:
   - local proof detection now recognizes successful `http_request` verification against local runtime APIs (`/api/generate`, `/api/chat`)
   - missions with valid API proof now complete cleanly instead of looping on `missing_local_runtime_proof`

## Reliability + Docs Clarification Pass

0. Hardened mission lifecycle against long-hanging controller turns:
   - added per-mission-step watchdog timeout around mission `agent.chat()` execution
   - timeout failures now terminate mission turns with explicit error evidence instead of indefinite `running/stopping` stalls
   - local-runtime cloud-controller missions now carry explicit mission turn timeout tuning

1. Hardened local-runtime recovery across providers:
   - recovery logic now detects provider/auth/model-not-found failure signals from mission replies
   - local-runtime missions can pivot controller back to configured Ollama model when non-Ollama provider path is failing

2. Updated operator docs to remove credential-source ambiguity:
   - clarified that `GET /api/config` is sanitized and cannot be used as key-presence truth source
   - documented `GET /api/providers/config` as readiness surface (`has*ApiKey`)
   - documented `GET /api/auth/catalog` as redacted auth/source surface
   - documented `POST /api/auth/prefill-local` as local secret scan/import path

3. Upgraded agent onboarding docs for faster operator bring-up:
   - rewrote `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md` with a 15-minute boot sequence
   - corrected credential verification flow to provider/auth endpoints
   - added mission/controller troubleshooting first-check sequence

4. Added competitive teardown reference from provided Claw Code source archive:
   - new `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_CLAW_CODE.md`
   - captures concrete deltas in prompt packing, tool-call translation, retry policy, hook pipeline, and bounded sub-agent execution

5. Added competitive teardown reference for OpenAI Codex source:
   - new `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_OPENAI_CODEX.md`
   - captures concrete deltas in policy engine shape, session recovery contracts, hook payload normalization, and fail-then-continue reliability testing

6. Added competitive teardown reference for Google Gemini CLI source:
   - new `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_GEMINI_CLI.md`
   - captures concrete deltas in scheduler state orchestration, mode-aware policy engine, plan-mode restrictions, hook interception, and failure-class fallback handling

7. Added consolidated controller roadmap:
   - new `docs/OPENUNUM_MULTI_MODEL_CONTROLLER_ACTION_PLAN.md`
   - merges Claw/Codex/Gemini reliability patterns into a phased OpenUnum implementation sequence with acceptance gates and a cross-provider test matrix

8. Added model-execution envelope enforcement for lightweight-model reliability:
   - new `src/core/model-execution-envelope.mjs`
   - runtime now infers `compact`/`balanced`/`full` execution tier per active provider/model
   - compact tiers can receive backend-enforced tool allowlists and lower turn iteration budgets
   - context-history fetch in agent loop now scales by execution envelope (`maxHistoryMessages`)

9. Hardened backend tool gating for profile-aware operation:
   - `src/tools/runtime.mjs` now supports tool-schema filtering by allowlist
   - tool execution now returns explicit `model_profile_tool_restricted` when an out-of-profile tool is called
   - controller passes per-turn allowed tool set into runtime execution context

10. Improved frontend/backend dynamic wiring for provider/model control:
   - capabilities payload now exposes dynamic provider order and auth-service ids
   - WebUI now hydrates provider and service lists from runtime capabilities/catalog instead of static arrays
   - fallback model handling now strips provider prefixes dynamically (no hardcoded provider regex dependency)
   - runtime overview now surfaces active execution envelope tier and limits

11. Added autonomous execution-policy engine with self-preservation defaults:
   - new `src/core/execution-policy-engine.mjs`
   - centralized policy decisions now support `plan` vs `execute` mode without requiring human approval prompts
   - shell self-destruct patterns are blocked by policy (`pkill/killall openunum/node`, `systemctl stop openunum`, hard reset/clean patterns, destructive repo wipe forms)

12. Added local restoration path for self-modifying file operations:
   - `file_write` and `file_patch` now create local backups in `~/.openunum/backups`
   - new tool `file_restore_last` restores the latest backup (optionally by path)

13. Added typed provider-failure classification and deterministic fallback actions:
   - new `src/core/provider-fallback-policy.mjs`
   - failures are now classified (`timeout`, `network`, `auth`, `not_found`, `quota`, `rate_limited`, `unknown`)
   - controller uses per-class policy (`retry_same_provider` vs `switch_provider` with cooldown)
   - provider cooldown state is tracked in-agent to avoid route thrashing

14. Exposed provider availability/cooldown status in runtime overview:
   - `/api/runtime/overview` now includes `providerAvailability`
   - WebUI runtime summary now surfaces provider cooldown/failure-kind metadata

15. Added explicit mission completion contracts with autonomous enforcement:
   - missions now infer a contract (`local-runtime-proof-v1`, `coding-proof-v1`, or `generic-proof-v1`)
   - `MISSION_STATUS: DONE` is accepted only when contract proof/checkpoint requirements pass
   - contract violations are recorded in mission logs and status payloads

16. Added autonomous rollback strategy when proof/contract failures repeat:
   - repeated DONE-without-contract-proof now triggers one automatic `file_restore_last` attempt
   - rollback result and attempt count are persisted in mission timeline/status metadata

Date: 2026-04-01

## Current Flagship Pass

0. Added model-aware controller scaffolding for cross-provider execution:
   - new behavior class registry in `src/core/model-behavior-registry.mjs`
   - new class-aware context pack builder in `src/core/context-pack-builder.mjs`
   - new execution contract helpers in `src/core/execution-contract.mjs`
   - provider turns now emit behavior metadata in trace (`behaviorClass`, `behaviorConfidence`, `behaviorSource`)
   - controller now enforces proof-backed completion and planner-without-execution continuation
   - learned behavior-class assignments now persist in SQLite (`controller_behaviors`) and are rehydrated on startup
   - added `GET /api/controller/behaviors` for operator inspection of in-memory vs persisted behavior state
   - behavior tuning now only tightens (never loosens) base execution profile budgets
   - local-runtime missions on Ollama cloud controllers now clamp provider/turn budgets and iteration caps during mission execution, then restore baseline runtime settings afterward
   - config now supports optional `model.behaviorOverrides`
   - added implementation guide: `docs/MODEL_AWARE_CONTROLLER.md`

1. Hardened local-runtime mission execution and provider portability:
   - tool/runtime turn budget enforcement now covers slow tool routes and nonproductive retries
   - deterministic shell syntax/usage failures stop retrying early
   - local-runtime missions detect prior proof and can complete from verified runtime output
   - bounded `http_request` path is now preferred for API verification, including shell-to-API curl rewrites
   - bad Ollama CLI forms (`invoke`, unsupported `run` flags) now produce explicit recovery steering instead of repeated dead-end attempts
   - NVIDIA full model ids are normalized correctly for OpenAI-compatible transport
   - local aggressive Qwen models now have explicit 16k context hints, with validation documenting that they still cannot serve as controllers over current Ollama tool-calling transport

2. Added `GET /api/capabilities` for capability-driven WebUI wiring.
3. Added `GET /api/model-catalog` with canonical provider order:
   - `ollama`
   - `nvidia`
   - `openrouter`
   - `openai`
4. Normalized legacy `generic` provider state to canonical `openai` while preserving read compatibility.
5. Upgraded `/api/config` to include:
   - `capabilities`
   - `modelCatalog`
   - `providerConfig`
6. Upgraded `/api/providers/config` to expose `openaiBaseUrl` and `hasOpenaiApiKey`, with legacy `generic*` aliases preserved.
7. Standardized WebUI shell markers for the cross-repo contract:
   - stable status bar
   - session search
   - provider/model/fallback/autonomy controls
   - trace panel

   - `tests/phase11.e2e.mjs`
8. Reset the live flagship runtime on `127.0.0.1:18880` back to `autonomy-first`.
9. Harvested flagship features from the other products into `openunum`:
   - OpenBat-style quick prompts and operator-friendly control surface
   - Gemini-style browser telemetry/runtime cards
   - Qwen-style Git/runtime visibility
   - Codex/Claude-style provider health summary cards
10. Added donor-inspired execution logic improvements after reviewing `OpenBat/source`:
   - heuristic tool routing hints injected before model execution
   - first-class permission denial tracking in execution trace
   - explicit per-turn trace summaries for tool runs / iterations / denials
11. Added operator-grade context/session controls to the flagship WebUI:
   - session export via `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/export`
   - explicit context budget telemetry from `GET /api/context/status`
   - one-click context compaction from the operator runtime view
12. Added a tactical ledger and pivot surface after deeper donor review:
   - `GET /api/autonomy/insights` to expose recent strategy outcomes, tool reliability, recent tool runs, and compactions
   - operator-side tactical ledger panel in the WebUI
   - per-turn `pivotHints` in execution trace based on denials, repeated tool failures, timeouts, and provider collapse
   - new `/ledger` slash command for quick operator summaries
13. Added replay import and filtered mission timeline tooling:
   - `POST /api/sessions/import` for session replay import
   - `POST /api/sessions/clone` for branchable replay from existing sessions
   - `GET /api/missions/timeline` for merged mission/operator playback
   - mission timeline filter/search controls in the WebUI
   - artifact drill-down from mission timeline into operator output
   - direct mission-session open/clone controls from the timeline
14. Added a secure provider/auth console pass to the flagship:
   - provider matrix table with endpoint, auth readiness, model count, and top-model visibility
   - secure auth vault for provider and adjacent integration credentials
   - redacted auth method table for GitHub, Google Workspace, HuggingFace, ElevenLabs, Telegram, OpenAI OAuth, and GitHub Copilot
15. Added secure secret persistence outside `openunum.json`:
   - new `~/.openunum/secrets.json` store written with mode `0600`
   - legacy provider/Telegram secrets are migrated out of config on load
   - `GET /api/config` is now sanitized and no longer returns raw secrets
16. Added new provider/auth endpoints:
   - `GET /api/auth/catalog`
   - `POST /api/auth/catalog`
   - `POST /api/auth/prefill-local`
17. Expanded local auth discovery beyond the old OpenClaw importer:

   - provider matrix and auth vault WebUI markers
19. Simplified the provider UX after operator review:
   - split the screen into compact `Model Providers` and `Service Providers` tables
   - reduced default row content to status, auth, summary, and action
   - moved endpoint/discovery details behind per-row `Advanced` toggles
   - added row hide/add controls to keep the default screen smaller
20. Simplified model routing:
   - retained all four providers in the shared catalog
   - replaced fallback profiles with an explicit ordered fallback sequence editor
   - primary provider/model selection now sits above a concrete per-provider fallback list
21. Added row-level test/connect actions:
   - `POST /api/provider/test`
   - `POST /api/service/test`
   - `POST /api/service/connect`
   - service OAuth kick-off supports GitHub CLI plus native `openunum` browser flows for OpenAI Codex and Google Workspace
22. Fixed service OAuth flows in the flagship Providers screen:
   - `openai-oauth` now discovers and reuses existing OpenClaw Codex OAuth profiles from `~/.openclaw/agents/*/agent/auth-profiles.json`
   - `openai-oauth` `Connect` now starts a native `openunum` OAuth job with browser/callback handling and optional manual code paste fallback
   - native OpenAI OAuth credentials are now persisted in `~/.openunum/secrets.json` under `oauth.openaiCodex`
   - `google-workspace` now saves native Google OAuth client config in `~/.openunum/secrets.json` and starts a browser/callback PKCE flow without `gcloud`
   - the Providers UI now exposes `Connect` for OpenAI OAuth in the same row-level action model as the other OAuth-capable services
23. Aligned auth and provider state for OpenAI OAuth:
   - `GET /api/auth/job` and `POST /api/auth/job/input` added for browser-driven OAuth orchestration
   - OpenAI provider auth readiness now recognizes native/compat OpenAI Codex OAuth even when no OpenAI API key is configured
   - OpenAI model catalog stays available from seeded policy models while OAuth is present
24. Wired native OpenAI Codex OAuth into actual model execution:
   - added `src/providers/openai-codex-oauth.mjs`
   - `openai` provider selection now prefers Codex OAuth transport for GPT-5 and Codex-family OpenAI models
   - non-Codex OpenAI models still use API-key `/chat/completions` when an API key is configured
   - provider loop now preserves assistant tool-call metadata between tool iterations so Codex tool continuation works correctly
   - added `tests/phase12.openai-codex-provider.e2e.mjs`
25. Expanded seeded OpenAI catalog coverage for OAuth-capable model routing:
   - `gpt-5.4-pro`

   - `gpt-5.4-nano`
   - `gpt-5.3-codex`
   - `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
26. Replaced the old Google Workspace CLI dependency with native `openunum` Google OAuth and API calls:
   - added `src/oauth/google-workspace.mjs`
   - `src/tools/google-workspace.mjs` now refreshes Google tokens and calls Gmail/Google APIs directly
   - Providers -> Google Workspace now saves client ID, optional client secret, and scopes through `/api/auth/catalog`
   - added `tests/phase13.google-workspace-native.e2e.mjs`
27. Hardened the Google Workspace OAuth UX:
   - `Connect` now auto-saves the current Google row before starting OAuth
   - blank secret inputs no longer wipe the stored Google client secret
   - malformed Google client IDs are rejected locally before the browser opens
   - downloaded Google OAuth JSON can be pasted directly and is normalized into client credentials

## Major Additions

1. Menu-driven Web UI with center-panel view switching.
2. Chat execution trace visibility (expand/collapse) with in-flight typing animation.
3. Provider/model routing hardening and strict primary-provider mode.
4. Deterministic model identity responses from runtime state.
5. Browser launch diagnostics and managed CDP launch endpoint.
6. Autonomy mode presets API (`standard` / `relentless`).
7. Mission engine upgrades:
   - retry support
   - continue-until-done mode
   - hard cap control
   - proof-aware completion requirement
8. Persistent learning memory additions:
   - `tool_runs`
   - `strategy_outcomes`
9. ExecutorDaemon added for retry/backoff command/tool execution.
10. Direct download capability via `http_download` tool.
11. Chat reliability hardening:
   - UI request timeout + robust spinner cleanup
   - server pending-chat lifecycle (`/api/chat` 202 pending)
   - pending poll endpoint (`GET /api/chat/pending`)
   - session-route decode fix for history lookup
12. Runtime timeout controls:
   - `runtime.providerRequestTimeoutMs`
   - `runtime.agentTurnTimeoutMs`
13. Chat `/auto` mission command:
   - `/auto <goal>` starts mission execution from chat
   - auto-polls mission progress and posts final status in the same bubble
14. Agent anti-halt continuation:
   - if a turn has already executed tools and then emits planning-only text with no new tool calls,
     OpenUnum now forces up to two additional continuation passes before returning.
15. Default auto-escalation from chat:
   - new `Auto: On/Off` toggle in chat header (default ON, persisted in localStorage)
   - when enabled, planning-style non-final replies are auto-promoted to mission `/auto` continuation.
16. Live background activity visibility during typing:
   - new `Live: On/Off` toggle in chat header (default ON)
   - pending chat bubbles now show expandable live tool calls/results
   - new API endpoint: `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/activity?since=...`
17. Request timeout hardening:
   - UI chat timeout increased and now auto-falls back to pending/live mode on timeout
   - `/api/chat` now returns `pending` quickly (20s window) for long-running turns
18. `/auto` mission resilience:
   - when mission polling returns `mission_not_found` (e.g., runtime restart),
     chat now auto-restarts the mission up to 2 times instead of stopping immediately.
19. Try-by-try visibility in chat bubble:
   - pending and `/auto` flows now record background attempts/retries/events in an expandable
     "Attempts & Retries" panel within the active assistant bubble.
20. Status-check auto-resume:
   - messages like `are you done?` no longer dead-end on planning replies.
   - if planning is detected, OpenUnum resumes `/auto` with the last actionable user task prompt.

## Stability/Validation

- Full phase E2E suite passing (`phase0` to `phase7`) after each major upgrade pass.

## Architectural Direction

OpenUnum is now oriented around:
- evidence-backed autonomous execution
- durable memory for strategy reuse
- operator-facing transparency into tool behavior

## 2026-04-03 Generic Autonomy Upgrade

1. Planner-backed generic task framework:
   - added `GoalTaskPlanner` for plain-language goal compilation
   - added `TaskOrchestrator` for reusable step execution, verification, and monitoring
   - new APIs:
     - `POST /api/autonomy/tasks/plan`
     - `GET /api/autonomy/tasks`
     - `GET /api/autonomy/tasks/status`
     - `POST /api/autonomy/tasks/run`
2. Restart-safe task persistence:
   - SQLite tables:
     - `task_records`
     - `task_step_results`
     - `task_check_results`
   - running tasks are marked `interrupted` after restart instead of disappearing
3. Planner-backed chat `/auto`:
   - `/auto <goal>` now launches a generic task, not a hardcoded single mission step
   - preflight evidence and mission execution can share one session id
4. New autonomy components:
   - `worker-orchestrator`
   - `self-edit-pipeline`
   - `model-scout-workflow`
   - `autonomy-registry`
5. Runtime/autonomy docs updated:
   - onboarding
   - codebase map
   - UI behavior
   - API reference
6. Execution-envelope classifier fix:
   - `397b`/large cloud models no longer misclassify as compact due to substring matches such as `7b` inside `397b`

## 2026-04-03 — Telegram Long Message Chunking

### Bug Fix
1. Fixed Telegram message delivery failures for long responses:
   - Telegram API has a 4096 character limit per message
   - Previously, long agent replies would fail silently (error logged but not shown to user)
   - Added automatic message chunking in `src/channels/telegram.mjs`

### Implementation
2. New `chunkMessage()` method splits long text at natural breakpoints:
   - First tries paragraph breaks (`\n\n`)
   - Falls back to line breaks (`\n`)
   - Hard splits for extremely long single paragraphs (with 100-char safety margin)

3. Multi-part messages include sequence markers:
   - Format: `( 1/3 )`, `( 2/3 )`, `( 3/3 )`
   - Small 100ms delay between chunks to avoid rate limiting
   - Markdown parsing disabled for multi-part messages to avoid cross-chunk parsing issues

### Files Changed
- `src/channels/telegram.mjs` — Added chunking logic and multi-send support
